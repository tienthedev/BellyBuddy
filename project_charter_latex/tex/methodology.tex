We will develop a Android mobile app that consolidates patient journal entries, food logging, symptom tracking, weight, and lab data. The app will include informative data graphs and PDF export for physicians. Future features may include food pattern correlation analysis, barcode scanning, OCR ingredients reader, and other important features through research on GI diseases. The project will follow an Agile sprint based approach with user feedback guiding each sprint.
